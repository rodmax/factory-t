TypeScript library for building data objects.

Useful for unit tests and mocking data during development.

With strong typing in mind.

## Goals

-   Provide a factory for building data objects based on a predefined config
-   The factory instance should **strongly depend** on the target TypeScript
    interface, so if the interface changes, the factory should not be built
    until it is synced with the interface changes
-   All kinds of API "sugar" are appreciated, but with typings in mind

## Install

```bash
npm install factory-t
```

## Usage

To get started you need to:

-   Design your data type
<!-- embedme ./src/tests/readme-snippets.test.ts#L6-L15-->

```ts
interface UserDto {
    id: number;
    email: string;
    phone: string | null;
    profile: {
        avatarUrl: string;
        language: 'EN' | 'RU';
        statusString?: string;
    };
}
```

-   Import the right tools
<!-- embedme ./src/tests/readme-snippets.test.ts#L1-L1-->

```ts
import { factoryT, fields } from 'factory-t';
```

-   Create a factory (or a set of factories)
<!-- embedme ./src/tests/readme-snippets.test.ts#L17-L28-->

```ts
const profileFactory = factoryT<UserDto['profile']>({
    avatarUrl: 'my.site/avatar',
    language: fields.sequence(['EN', 'RU']),
    statusString: fields.optional('sleeping'),
});

const userFactory = factoryT<UserDto>({
    id: fields.index(),
    email: (ctx) => `user-${ctx.index}@g.com`,
    phone: fields.nullable('+127788'),
    profile: (ctx) => profileFactory.item({ avatarUrl: `/avatars/${ctx.index}` }),
});
```

-   Use it to build objects

<!-- embedme ./src/tests/readme-snippets.test.ts#L30-L39-->

```ts
expect(userFactory.item({ phone: null })).toStrictEqual({
    id: 1,
    email: 'user-1@g.com',
    phone: null, // overridden by the partial passed to item(...)
    profile: {
        avatarUrl: '/avatars/1', // overridden by userFactory using its index
        language: 'EN',
        statusString: 'sleeping',
    },
});
```

See [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) and/or
[unit test](./src/tests/factory-t.test.ts) for details.

## Status

I use this library in all my current projects (mostly for unit tests).

In my opinion, it has a simple implementation, so if you like its API, you can
try using it too.

## Similar projects

### [rosie](https://github.com/rosiejs/rosie) - nice library, good intuitive API

If you write in JavaScript, it should solve all your needs.

The main drawback is typings. This library has `@types/rosie`, but it uses a
"builder" pattern which does not allow strong type checking between the factory
and the target interface.
